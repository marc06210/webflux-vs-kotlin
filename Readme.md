## api-server

Project that exposes the /persons... endpoints

## reactive-test-app

Code shown during blured presentation

## kotlin

The kotlin samples do not cover the SOA part of the demo and is here only for information. Moreover the addressed endpoints are /person (without any s).

At this very moment (Feb 2022) there is no official support by TECC/SE backend on kotlin :)
