## api-server

Project that exposes the **/persons**... endpoints

## reactive-test-app

Code shown during blured presentation

## kotlin

The kotlin samples <u>do not</u> cover the SOA part of the demo and are here only for information. 

In kotlin no need to use additional framework to process asynchronous calls, it is handled with natural kotlin coroutines. 

As additional information, the addressed endpoints are **/person** (without any s).

At this very moment (Feb 2022) there is no official support by TECC/SE backend on kotlin :)
