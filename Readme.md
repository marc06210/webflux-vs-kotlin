## api-server

Project that exposes the **/persons**... endpoints

## reactive-test-app

Code to demonstrate the usage of the Spring WebFlux functionalities.

## kotlin 

The same code in kotlin for a code comparison. The database part is not covered.

The kotlin samples <u>do not</u> cover the SOA part of the demo and are here only for information. 

In kotlin no need to use additional framework to process asynchronous calls, it is handled with natural kotlin coroutines. 

As additional information, the addressed endpoints are **/person** (without any s).
